# DSA: Trees

**What is a leaf node? Why is it important to be able to find leaf nodes?** 
A leaf node is a something of a dead end, or rather has no children or connections to it.


**Describe the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Why are they called pre, in, and post order?**
- Pre order - root, left, right Called so because we begin with the root node
- In order - left, root, right Called so because we name the nodes in order of 'appearance' like reading a book.
- Post Order -  left, right, root Called so because we name the nodes in the reverse order in which they are called.



**What is the height of a fully balanced (each non-leaf node has two children) tree? What is this used for?**
- The height of a fully balanced tree is 2^(h-1) and the only thing I can think this is used for is to get an idea of how long it is going to take to traverse a tree. 


**How are stacks and queues used in relation to trees?**
- The stack method is used to hold reference to the nodes in a tree and then used to pop the top node off the stack.
