# React Native

** What is native development? **

- Native development is React used to create mobile apps, rather than desktop apps. It allows the developer to access mobile tools, like GPS or the microphone in a much simpler way. Best of all? No CSS.

** Why is it important to develop a native app vs a responsive react app?** 

- native apps can be installed directly onto the phone and work in a much smoother way with the mobile devices OS.
