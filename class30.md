# Graphs

- Undirected Graphs have edges that are undirected or bi-directional

- Directed Graphs have directions when edges point in one direction to a node / vertices

- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to each other

- A connected graph is when all nodes have at least one edge. A Tree is a connected graph

- A disconnected graph is when not all nodes are connected to another graph. One or more nodes moght not have any edges

- An Acyclic graph doesn't have cycles. A linked list is an acyclic graph. Or a Tree

- A Cyclic graph has cycles, a doublely linked list, for example
