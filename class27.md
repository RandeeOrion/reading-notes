# Hooks API / Custom Hooks

**Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?**

- This allows us to return stateful variables 

**What do custom hooks usually do?**

- This allows flexibility and the sharing of logic

**Using the links above, list one custom hook that you would be interested in trying/using.**

- Obviously the useArray hook is on the top of my list right this moment, as is the react-use-form-state hook. 
- React-friebase-hooks look really rad, though I am going to be honest and say that I am not entierly sure what they do.
