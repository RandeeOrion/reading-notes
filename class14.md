# Access Control (ACL)

**Why is access control important? Describe an application that would need access control.**

Access control allows to restrict different users to different levels. For example, you may want a client to be able to access information, but not to be able to edit that information. 

**What is a role used for?**
A role is used to manage access control for different users. You may have DB that an employee needs to be able to view, but can't add or delete from, but another employee, maybe more trusted or trained or proven, needs to be able to update the database. 

**Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**

Role based access control can be assigned when a new user is created with all of the rules or access already created. Discretionary or mandatory access will be written for each new user created. Role based is a check the box we already created sort of thing where as discretionary or mandatory is shooting from the hip and making things up as we go along.
