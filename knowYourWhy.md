# Purpose Practice Sheet

### Pinpoint Your Values
- What motivates me to get up in the morning? 
  Honestly, my children are so little and we are so strapped for time and energy, that I get out of bed completely exhausted and get up only because the thought of what my children will do to the house if we are not up is more exhausting than the exhausted feeling I wake up with. 

- What keeps me up at night? 
  If I am laying in bed and can't sleep, which is rare, it is because I have either pushed through my natural sleep cycle, or I am worried about money. 

- What am I doing when I'm at my best?
  I am laughing and playing and trusting the universe to provide what I need and living in the moment. 

- Why am I bothered by what bothers me? 
  Often what bothers me in others or the world around me, is what bothers me about myself. My own short comings. 

- Why do I buy what I buy? 
  I buy what I buy, often because it is either what my family needs or will make life easier for my family. I try to buy local and sustainable when I can because I believe in communities and that a strong local commerce makes for a strong local community.

- Why do I long for what I long for? 
  I usually long for what I long for because I am unhappy in my current sitution, for whatever reason. 

- Why do I read and watch what I do?
  I read what I read and watch what I watch because they are either easy to access or bring me joy.

- Why do I admire whom I admire?
  I often admire those who are doing the things I want to do or behaving in a way that I want to behave. 

- When am I happy? 
  I am happy when I am well rested, find moments of quiet for myself and have properly fueled my body. 

- Why do I have the relationships that I have?
  Sometimes because they were relationships I was born into, sometimes because they are relationships I have stumbled into and sometimes because they are relationships I have sought and fostered.


### Consider Your Options 
##### List your opportunities
  - to learn to be more curious and patient 
  - to learn how to listen better
  - to learn how to slow down and weigh options, I am excellent at making decisions quickly

###### list your core values based on your answers above
  - patiences and curiosity 
  - inclusion
  - self awareness
 
##### What have you decided is your purpose? 
  - This is such a massive question and to presume that this teeny tiny questionnaire can lead to a revelation such as this is absurd. However, right now, my purpose is to show my girls that even as a middle aged housewife, they can completely redefine themselves. When the world around them is telling them to shrink, they should grow.

### Make Room for What You Love

##### Maximize 
- Time to work on homework 
- Time to move my body so I can focus
- Baths with lavender and a good book

##### Minimize 
- Distractions 
- Social media
- Chocolate candies 


### Filter By Purpose 
##### When you're feeling out of sorts about what's going on in your life, or if you're trying to decide if a new opportunity fits your purpose, use these questions to filter() through to an answer.
- What core value does this fit with? 
- What level of excitement do I have about this? 
- Will / does this distract from something else that is very important to me? 
- How might this play out in the future?
