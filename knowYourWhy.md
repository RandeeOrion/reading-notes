# Purpose Practice Sheet

### Pinpoint Your Values
- What motivates me to get up in the morning? 
  Honestly, my children are so little and we are so strapped for time and energy, that I get out of bed completely exhausted and get up only because the thought of what my children will do to the house if we are not up is more exhausting than the exhausted feeling I wake up with. 
- What keeps me up at night? 
  If I am laying in bed and can't sleep, which is rare, it is because I have either pushed through my natural sleep cycle, or I am worried about money. 
- What am I doing when I'm at my best?
  I am laughing and playing and trusting the universe to provide what I need and living in the moment. 
- Why am I bothered by what bothers me? 
  Often what bothers me in others or the world around me, is what bothers me about myself. My own short comings. 
- Why do I do the work I do? 

- Why do I buy what I buy? 
  
- Why do I long for what I long for? 
- Why do I read and watch what I do? 
- Why do I admire whom I admire? 
- When am I happy? 
- Why do I have the relationships that I have?

### Filter By Purpose 
##### When you're feeling out of sorts about what's going on in your life, or if you're trying to decide if a new opportunity fits your purpose, use these questions to filter() through to an answer.
- What core value does this fit with? 
- What level of excitement do I have about this? 
- Will / does this distract from something else that is very important to me? 
- How might this play out in the future?
