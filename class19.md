# Message Queues

**What is the main benefit of a message queue server?**

- A message queue is something like a centralized message board, allowing for easier scalability and growth of an app. It allows all connected servers to share data and stay up to date with such data. 

**Why might we want to initiate messages from an HTTP request?**

- If there is a small bit of data that needs to be transmitted 'I agree to your insane lack of privacy policy' for example, that can be sent quickly through the HTTP request and move things along. 

**Is the Message Queue Server a socket.io client, a socket.io server, or an api server?**

- socket.io server
